# librerambox-default-theme/examples

This folder contains example applications demonstrating this package.
Each of these applications will be built as part of the package build:

```bash
cd /path/to/package
sencha package build
```

As applications, they can also be built individually:

```bash
cd /path/to/package/examples/example-app
sencha app build
```

Or you can build all examples as a group:

```bash
cd /path/to/package
sencha ant examples
```

The ideal location for the example builds to reside is the `"./build"` folder:

```text
/path/to/package/
    src/
    resources/
        ...
    examples/
        example-app/
        other-example/
        ...
    build/
        resources/
        examples/
            example-app/
            other-example/
```

This can be specified in the `".sencha/app/build.properties"` file for the example applications:

`build.dir=${package.build.dir}/examples/${app.name}`
